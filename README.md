## 📌 Key Project

### 🔋 **BAAS**

A **BaaS (Battery-as-a-Service) data analysis dashboard** developed as part of a **team / organizational project**.

* Implemented **frontend UI components** for a BaaS data analysis dashboard
* Built with **React + TypeScript (TSX)**, focusing on component structure and state-driven rendering
* Visualized **time-series operational data** stored in InfluxDB
* Backend APIs were used only to the extent necessary to support dashboard data access
* Stack: **React (TypeScript/TSX) · FastAPI · InfluxDB**

---

### 🤖 **BAAS LLM Agent**

A small project exploring the **feasibility of applying LLMs, RAG** to industrial or process-related data.

* Implemented a simple RAG-style Q&A flow over limited documents
* Verified that RAG improves response relevance compared to naive prompting in a constrained domain
* Focused on understanding retrieval, context injection, and answer grounding behavior

---

## 🔍 Engineering Insight

* Small-to-mid scale models (≈2B parameters) fit comfortably on a single GPU
* For this scale, **distributed training overhead can outweigh performance gains**
* Techniques such as **FSDP become necessary only at very large model scales (≈70B+)**

---

## 🚀 Current Interests

* Improving skills in **industrial data analysis and visualization**
* Deeper understanding of **time-series data systems** (e.g., InfluxDB)
* Studying **ontology modeling (OWL) and knowledge graph combined subjects**
* Continued study of **LLMs and AI system design** for future application
